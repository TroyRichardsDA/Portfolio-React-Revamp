              Let's talk about me as a person. I'm a gamer. Moba's take up a
              good amount of my games list with Smite being at the top of that
              list. I promise you, that my jungle is saucey. It's not SPL saucey
              but it's close. Give me any assassin expect Awilix and the
              rotations will be on point. Another thing about me is I use to
              make use of my degree in audio production and make music. However,
              when covid hit, I had to sell a lot of my equipment to get by.
              Eventually, somewhere down the line I will buy back my equipment
              so I can get back to making music
